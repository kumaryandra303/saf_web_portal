# ✅ Browser Should Now Be Open!

I just automatically opened your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

## What You Should See:

### If Working Correctly: ✅
- **Red hero section** with "Settibalija Action Force" title
- **White SAF logo/shield** on the left
- **Stats showing**: ₹1Cr+ Corpus Fund, 1000+ Families Supported, 50+ Programs
- **Two buttons**: "About SAF" and "Join the Mission"
- **Navigation bar** at the top with SAF logo

### If Still Blank: ❌

Please do this:

1. **Press F12** on your keyboard (opens Developer Tools)
2. **Click "Console" tab** at the top
3. **Take a screenshot** of any red error messages
4. **Share the screenshot** with me

## Quick Checks:

### Check 1: Correct URL?
Look at your browser address bar. It should say:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
NOT 3001 or any other number!

### Check 2: Server Running?
Look at your terminal/command prompt. You should see:
```
VITE v5.4.21  ready in XXXXms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

### Check 3: Try Hard Refresh
Press: **Ctrl + Shift + R** (or **Ctrl + F5**)

## Still Not Working?

Tell me:
1. What do you see in the browser? (blank, error message, loading dots?)
2. What does the browser console show? (F12 → Console tab)
3. Is the terminal showing any errors?

I'll help you fix it immediately! 🚀
